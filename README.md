# Thrustmaster TMX Force Feedback racing wheel kernel module for the Linux kernel
Linux kernel module for the Thrustmaster TMX Force Feedback racing wheel. — Haven't begun developement yet, only looking at what I should do and how. — Track the progress in GitHub issues or the TODOs part of the README.

**Note**: *I take no responsibility for any damages caused by the software. By that I mean devices ruined, devices bricked and more. Use this at your own risk.*

# Contributing
